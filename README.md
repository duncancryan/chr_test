I have provided the solution in both Python and Ruby.

To run the Python file, please run the following command in the root of this directory:
- 'python3 test.py'

To run the Ruby file, please run the following command in the root of this directory:
- ruby test.rb

I wrote the Python script first just to make sure I could deal with the logic relatively painlessly. 
Each function took about five minutes to write, with a little bit of time spent refamiliarising myself with the datetime docs.

I wanted to try my hand at the solution in Ruby just to get a bit of a feel for the language. I knew what the functions needed to do at this point but I spent a little bit of time familiarising myself with Syntax and keywords used in Ruby, as well as the way that classes and their methods are defined.
